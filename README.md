# Debian for toys

A (personal) set of scripts to build bootable Debian images for various architectures and development boards (or "toys", that's how we call them).

## Supported toys

* RISC-V
  * [RISC-V 64 QEMU](riscv64/qemu/README.md)

* POWER
  * [PPC64le QEMU](ppc64el/qemu/README.md)

More toys will be added as I acquire them and get them up and running (or migrate older scripts to this repository).
